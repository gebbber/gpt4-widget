# GPT-4 Usage Quota Widget

As a ChatGPT-Plus subscriber, it can be challenging to track your usage quota. This
'request timeline' widget demonstrates a simple way to represent your recent usage
visibly on a timeline.

Using the quota of 25 requests in 3 hours (as of March 26, 2023) as an example, the
timeline shows when requests were made during the interval of concern. For the sake
of demonstration, you can test its behavior by deleting individual requests below,
or by adding new ones&mdash;just hit the 'submit' button.

The circles representing the requests will change color from translucent green to
opaque red as you approach the quota, making it easy to gauge your usage.
