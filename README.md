# GPT-4 Usage Quota Widget

It can be challenging for ChatGPT-Plus subscribers to track their usage relative to
their quota. This 'request timeline' widget demonstrates a simple way to visually
represent a user's recent usage.

For the sake of demonstration, you can test its behavior by deleting individual
requests below, or by adding new ones&mdash;just hit the 'submit' button.

The circles representing the requests will change color from green to red as the
user approaches their quota, providing intuitive visual feedback as they approach
their limit.
